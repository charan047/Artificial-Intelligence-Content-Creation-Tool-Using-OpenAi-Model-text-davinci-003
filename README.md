# Artificial-Intelligence-Content-Creation-Using-OpenAi-Model-(text-davinci-003)

## This is a Content Creation Tool which is developed using the text-davinci-003 GPT model

You can use this model to <br>
-> Create Instagram captions for your post<br>
-> Generate any Programming language code<br>
-> Create a funny pickup line for the description you give<br>
-> Create a Mail Template with given Description<br>
-> Generate Instagram Reel or Youtube video ideas<br>
-> Generate Instagram Reel or Youtube video Description or caption<br>

The test-davinci-003 model is designed to perform a wide range of tasks with fewer instructions to achieve the required output and is particularly useful when in-depth knowledge of a subject matter is required. This includes summarising texts, and producing narrative content and dialogue.

To make it easier to use with more in-depth understanding Davinci-based models are more computationally heavy, which comes with a slightly higher cost per API call when compared to simpler models such as Ada and Babbage.

### To run this Project clone it and run using the command "flask run" in the following directory

### Before running this project in config.py file you need to put the api key which is different for every user so go to https://beta.openai.com/ -> profile -> view API keys-> if already superkey is created copy paste it and use it in config.py file or just click on Create new Super key

In future we can add more options and create as much as content needed in different fields.

#### Any contributions towards this project are accepted.
